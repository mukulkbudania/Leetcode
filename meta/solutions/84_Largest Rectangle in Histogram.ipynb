        "This problem asks us to find the largest rectangle in a histogram. A key insight is that for each bar, we can extend a rectangle horizontally until we hit a shorter bar. The area of this rectangle is the height of the current bar multiplied by the width of the extension.",

        "",
        "A more efficient approach uses a stack to keep track of bars in increasing order of height. When we encounter a bar shorter than the top of the stack, we know we can't extend the rectangle further to the right. At this point, we calculate the area of rectangles with heights of each popped bar.",
        "",
        "The algorithm works as follows:",
        "1. Use a stack to store indices of bars in increasing order of height.",
        "2. For each bar:",
        "* While the current bar is shorter than the bar at the top of the stack, pop the stack and calculate the area.",
        "* The width is the current position minus the position of the next bar on the stack (or 0 if the stack is empty).",
        "* Push the current bar's index onto the stack.",
        "3. After processing all bars, pop any remaining indices from the stack and calculate areas.",
