        "3. We'll create a repeated version of `a` by concatenating it multiple times.",
        "4. We need to ensure the repeated string is long enough to potentially contain `b`.",
        "5. The maximum length needed would be `len(a) + len(b) - 1`, which ensures we have enough characters to check if `b` can be a substring.",
        "6. After creating this repeated string, we check if `b` is a substring.",
        "7. If it is, we calculate how many repetitions of `a` are needed.",
        "8. If not, we return -1.",
        "",
        "The key insight is that we don't need to create an infinitely long string. If `b` can be a substring of repeated `a`, it must appear within the first `len(a) + len(b) - 1` characters of the repeated string."
