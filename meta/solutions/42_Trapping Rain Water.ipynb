        "1. **Brute Force**: For each position, find the maximum height to its left and right, then calculate water trapped. This is O(n\u00b2) time complexity.",
        "",
        "2. **Dynamic Programming**: Precompute the maximum heights to the left and right for each position, then calculate water trapped. This is O(n) time and space.",
        "",

        "I'll implement the two-pointer approach as it's the most efficient. The idea is:",
        "* Use two pointers, left and right, starting from the ends of the array",

        "* At each step, determine which side has the smaller height",
