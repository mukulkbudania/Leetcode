    "The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (\" \").\n",
    "\n",
    "Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.\n",
