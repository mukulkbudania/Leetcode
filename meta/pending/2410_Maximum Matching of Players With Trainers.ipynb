    "One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.\n",

    "Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.\n",
