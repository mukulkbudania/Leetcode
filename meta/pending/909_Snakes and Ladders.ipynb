    "You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.\n",

    "Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].\n",
